## What do I know about IoT:
  Some things about Homeautomation and Carputers; mostly theoretical knowledge about sensors and actors and how to use such things at home or in cars.

## What are your expectations of this class?
   To get more knowledge about realising small IoT projects, like reading sensors controlling actors, voice control, communication  between devices.

## What does the Internet of things entail?
  The IoT makes it possible to connect two or more devices and share informations and controls between them. For example a temperature sensor in the living room sends ist information tot he oven in the cellar which is in- or decreasing the temperature. Gathering of informations like the temperatures and the needed oil for the heater.
