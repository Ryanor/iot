# Jarvis Home Assistant

## Speech recognition / Lights / Audio / Video / Smartlock

Ryan is heading home in his car. Shortly before he reaches the garage he says:"Jarvis open the garage door".
The garage door opens and the lights in the garage are turned on at his command.
Ryan drives inside the garage and turns off the motor.
At the same time the car audio system disconnects with Ryans smartphone.

When he closes the door of the car the garage door begins to close and Jarvis says:"Welcome home Sir.".
"Status update: Everything is working inside normal parameters. It is 16:20 and the temperature is constant at 20°C in all rooms."

The garage lights turn off as Ryan walks inside the house. Inside the house the lights automatically turn on when Ryan enters a room.
Ryan commands:"Jarvis please order a peperoni pizza from Alfredo´s and turn on music."
Jarvis:"Alfredo is closed till 17:00, do you want to order your pizza then?"
Ryan:"Yes."
The music starts playing.
As Ryan walks around in the house the music is following him.

Ryan:"Jarvis check my dates and make an appointment with my bank consultant."
Jarvis:"MyAlfred found an appointment with Mr. Müller on 23rd February at 10:00."
