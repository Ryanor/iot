# How to speak IoT?
## CBOR
### Concise Binary Object Representation

- Schema less exchange format
- seen as stream
- hard to read because it is transformed to binary
- recomended data serialization layer for the CoAP protocol
## Text
- Plain text
- HTML
- Rich Text Format


# Who does IoT?
## OCF
### Open Connectivity Foundation

- founded by Intel and Samsung
- over 300 members

Diamond Members:
	
- Microsoft, Canon, Cisco, LG, Samsung, CableLabs, Intel, Haier, Qualcomm, Electrolux
	
Purpose:

- Billions of connected devices (devices, phones, computers and sensors) should be able to communicate with one another regardless of manufacturer, operating system, chipset or physical transport. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) is creating a specification and sponsoring an open source project to make this possible.
- OCF delivers a framework that enables easy discovery, and trusted and reliable connectivity between things in a network via a specification and a certification program
	
Costs: 
- Diamond: 350.000 USD
- Platinum: 5.000 – 50.000 USD determined by the number of full time employees
- Gold: 2.000 USD
- Non-Profit: 1.0000 USD
- Basic: 0$

# Protocols

## MQTT Message Queue Telemetry Transport
- "lightweight" messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol.
- Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link authored the first version of the protocol in 1999.
- OASIS specification
- MQTT-SN for non TCP/IP networks like ZigBee
