## Participation 4

### Issues with scale:
- Interferring devices due to different protocols
- get a lot of data from the devices which may get lost or stay unused
- Fix and test bugs
- security and privacy

### Testing:
- Use simulator test programs
- stresstest the hardware

### Role play:
Simulator:
- no hardware needed for test scaling up a project
- find corner cases

MQTT:
- the broker can filter messages from single devices due to publish - subscribe pattern
- redundancy, use more MQTT broker

Stories:
- help us find the right amount of hardware devices
- help us find the right devices for our task
