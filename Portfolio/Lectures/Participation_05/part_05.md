## What I would like to see in an IoT Framework?

- easy to install and use 
- easy to flash programs on devices
- remote flash with selection of a specific device
- many tutorials or examples to learn the basics
- good documentation
- scalability
- support for many different development plattforms and devices
- IDE with code completion
- update over the air (UOTA)


## UlnoIoT

- why and when unloiot was created
- demonstration of ulniot
    -- services like Accesspoint, MQTT
    -- system_template demo with a button and a ligth
    -- using initialize to flash a connected board
    -- after flashing the board connect to the board via console_serial
    -- create a button with the button("b1", d2) command
    -- with command "devices" yout get a list of all created devices
    -- execute with "run()"
    -- create a button with the button("b1", d2,"down","up") command
    -- execute with "run()"
  
## Recap
- easy to install and to use
- easy to flash programs on devices
- remote flash support
- examples
- documentation
- scaleable
- supports different platforms
- Code complition with external IDE
- update over the air
