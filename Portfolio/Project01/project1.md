## Project 1
Max and his wife Erika together with their sons Mike and Luke live in a little house.
Mike and Luke are teenagers and share a room together. Because of their age it could get really loud in the evening
especially when the are playing or fighting.

Thats why Max installed a sound sensor in their room to get informed if
they are to loud again. The noise information is send to the central hub in the living room where the noise level is indicated by a RGB-LED which is GREEN if the level is OK or RED if Mike and Luke are to loud.

In the evening Max and Erika are enjoying the freetime in the living room. They watch TV, talk to each other or read magazines and books. To be sure to have a comfortable temperature Max installed a temperature sensor in the living room which triggers the oven in the cellar to turn on or off. The temperature value is also shown on a display in the hub.
