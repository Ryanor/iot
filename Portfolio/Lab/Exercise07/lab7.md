# Lab 7

## Scale
- assembled the scale
- installed HX711 library for scale
- calibrated scale with Arduino IDE and HX711 library example
	- for the calibration we used calibrations weights of 50g and 100g
	- with the calibration we get a we need to got a compensation value 
	which must be used in further programs to get the correct measurement

Failures:
- finished the assembly without wireing the components
- compensation value works in opposite direction
	- the lower the compensation value the higher the weight
	and vice versa
